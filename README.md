# Glow2MQTT

Note : This is all made possible by this project : https://github.com/cybermaggedon/pyglowmarkt All credit belongs with them!

You will need a glowmarkt.com account (free.. no need for their IHD) linked to your provider and receiving readings from your SMETS2 meter. This will only give you the halfhourly increments, but seeing as the energy dashboard in HA only reports hourly figures, it works just fine.

OS : 
ONLY TESTED ON UBUNTU 20.04

DEPENDENCIES : 
* apt install python3-pip
* pip install pyglowmarkt
 
SETUP : 
* timedatectl set-timezone Europe/London # Make sure your timezone is correct
* mkdir glow2mqtt
* cd glow2mqtt
* git clone https://github.com/danmed/Glow2MQTT.git
* edit consumption.sh to input your credentials.
* chmod a+x consumption.sh
* Then run the consumption.sh on a cronjob every... however long you want.. Glow only update every 30 minutes so if you check every 20 you should cover it off pretty well
